The University of London Symphony Orchestra (ULSO) is a not-for-profit organisation managed by students and supported by Student Central (formally the University of London Union).

We aim to store only as much information as we need to recruit and inform players to take part in our concerts.

As we do not take direct online payments, we will never ask for card details from any of our players or conductors. Membership subscriptions are paid directly to Student Central.

As the Committee of ULSO:

- We do not ask for details beyond what we need to organise concerts. The details we record are:
    - name
    - email address
    - mobile number
    - university attended
    - instrument played
    - description of your recent orchestral experience
    All of this is to help us gauge how suitable you are to yearly or temporary vacancies in the orchestra.
- Player details will be deleted after 3 years.
- Occasionally, other orchestras in London may ask us to provide them contact details of our players. Players can choose to opt out of this.
- For those that ULSO needs to pay or reimburse (conductors, committee members, harpists), payment details are stored in our Google Drives. Details like bank account numbers and addresses will never be stored on our web servers.
